=====================
IARP Django Utilities
=====================

A collection of django utilities I use a lot throughout many projects.

I only work with Python 3.6 and 3.7 currently, as such these may not work in
previous versions. Most notably due to f-strings.

Installation
============

    pip install -e git+https://iarp@bitbucket.org/iarp/iarp-django-utils.git#egg=iarp_django_utils

Documentation
=============

Every file and function is commented about what it does, how and when to use
it along with examples. Have a question? Open an issue.
